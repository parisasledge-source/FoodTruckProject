### FoodTruckProject

Food Truck App is a survey app for gathering information about different food trucks and their quality. (:input)

It displays a list of all existing food trucks and the type of their food along with their individual ratings, the average rating of the trucks and the highest rated truck. (:output)

#### Description

The user is prompted to enter a truck name: ("TacoRific", "Mediterranean Medic", etc.), food type ("Tacos", "Falafel", etc.), and the rating for that truck each time he/she is prompted to input data, for up to five times.

Then, the program calculates the average rating of the trucks based on the users's input of each truck's individual rating by adding them all together and dividing the result by the number of the trucks.
The program also calculates the highest rated truck by comparing the ratings to each other one step at a time.

The user can input 'quit' or 'Quit' if they decide to have entries for less than 5 trucks. The input 'quit' or 'Quit' can only be entered when the user is prompted for the food truck name.
In that case, input ends immediately and the menu will be displayed.
The menu is displayed after either user's input for all 5 food trucks or the input for quitting.

The program will display the menu from which the user can choose to:

1. List all existing food trucks.
2. See the average rating of food trucks.
3. Display the highest-rated food truck.
4. Quit the program.

Based on the user input (from 1 to 4) at this point, the program displays a list of all existing food trucks and the type of their food along with their individual ratings, the average rating of the trucks and the highest rated truck.

#### Lessons Learned

1. The use of getter and setter in the second class and how they interact with the class with the main method.

2. The use of to String method and how it interacts with main method in the main class in order to type a string of results.

3. The use of Objects and Array of Objects, which in this program in the Food Truck Array.

4. Proper use of 'break' in a loop to avoid entering an endless loop and being able to quit and exit the program when needed.


#### Technologies Used

1. Generating Getters and Setters
2. Generating toString()
3. Generating no Arg constructor
4. Generating constructor using fields
5. Using Do While Loop Break
6. Using For Loop Break
